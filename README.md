# Chutes & Ladders 🪜🛝

An online version of the classic board game, chutes and ladders. 


## How to Play

The goal of the game is to make it to the end of the board in 10 turns or less.

To begin playing the player must click on the dice to roll a number 1 through 6. After rolling notice that a turn has been removed from your initial total of 10 and the board has been updated with your piece's location. 

Everytime you roll onto the bottom of a ladder, the piece moves up the ladder. Similarly, everytime you roll onto the top of a chute your piece slides down the chute.
